# Core Principles

P-1: **Documentation-First Development** - Document design decisions, architecture changes, and important findings. Use the docs system.

P-2: **Clear Code Over Clever Code** - Write code that is easy to understand and maintain. Document non-obvious decisions.

P-3: **Testing Matters** - Write tests for critical functionality. Ensure builds pass before committing.

P-4: **Security Consciousness** - Never commit secrets or credentials. Validate external inputs. Follow secure coding practices.

P-5: **User Experience Focus** - Terminal UX should be intuitive and responsive. Test on actual terminals.

P-6: **Separation of Concerns** - Keep game logic separate from UI. Maintain clear boundaries between layers.

P-7: **Performance Awareness** - Monitor memory usage and performance. Optimize when needed, not prematurely.

P-8: **Build Automation** - All build and deployment processes must be reproducible and automated.

P-9: **Version Control Hygiene** - Commit messages should be clear. Branch names should be descriptive. Keep history clean.

P-10: **When in doubt, ask** - Clarify requirements before implementing. Don't assume.
