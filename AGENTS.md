# Agents

This repository's canonical agent configuration lives under the `.agent/` directory:

- `.agent/rules/` – shared agent rules and principles
- `.agent/workflows/` – canonical workflows
- `.agent/adapters/` – platform adapters (see `.agent/adapters/README.md`)

Use these `.agent` rules and adapters as the single source of truth for agents and IDE integrations.
This top-level file is intentionally just a pointer to help humans and tools discover the `.agent` tree.
