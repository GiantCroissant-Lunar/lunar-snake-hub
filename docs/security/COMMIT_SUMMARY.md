## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Post-Commit Actions Required

### 1. Update CI/CD Secrets

The new private key must be added to CI/CD:

```bash
cat .sops/age.key
```

Update this in:

- GitHub Actions secrets (as `SOPS_AGE_KEY`)
- Any other CI/CD systems

### 2. Clean Git History

The old private key still exists in git history and MUST be removed:

```bash
# Method 1: Using task command
task sops:clean-history

# Method 2: Manual
brew install git-filter-repo
git filter-repo --path .sops/age.key --invert-paths --force
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
```

**⚠️ WARNING: This rewrites history. All collaborators must re-clone!**

### 3. Test Services

```bash
task infra:setup      # Generate .env from new secrets
task infra:restart    # Restart with new credentials
task infra:status     # Verify services are running
```

### 4. Notify Team

After force pushing:

- Inform all collaborators
- Ask them to delete local clones and re-clone
- Verify everyone has access

## 📊 What's Different

### Before (Compromised)

- ❌ Private key in git
- ❌ Old API keys/passwords exposed
- ❌ No rotation procedures
- ❌ Manual SOPS management

### After (Secure)

- ✅ New private key (not in git)
- ✅ All new API keys/passwords
- ✅ Automated rotation scripts
- ✅ Task commands for SOPS
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Proper .gitignore patterns

## 🎯 Verification Checklist

Before considering this complete:

- [ ] This commit pushed
- [ ] CI/CD updated with new private key
- [ ] Git history cleaned (old key removed)
- [ ] Force push completed
- [ ] Services restarted and tested
- [ ] All collaborators notified
- [ ] Everyone re-cloned repository
- [ ] Old backup files deleted (after verification)

## 📚 Documentation

- Master index: `docs/security/README.md`
- Quick guide: `docs/security/ROTATION_COMPLETE.md`
- Detailed guide: `docs/security/AGE_KEY_ROTATION.md`
- Scripts: `infra/secrets/*.sh`
- Task commands: `task sops:*`

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

1. **The old private key is COMPROMISED** - Anyone with git history can decrypt old versions
2. **Old secret values are INVALID** - All rotated to new values
3. **Git history MUST be cleaned** - Old key must be purged
4. **CI/CD MUST be updated** - Or deployments will fail
5. **Team MUST re-clone** - After history rewrite

---

## ✅ What This Achieves

- ✅ New encryption key protecting secrets
- ✅ New actual secret values (passwords, tokens, API keys)
- ✅ Automation for future rotations
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Security best practices enforced
- ✅ Easy-to-use task commands

**The infrastructure is now secure with proper rotation procedures in place.**
