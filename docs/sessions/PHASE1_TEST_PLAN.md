# Phase 1 Comprehensive Test Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Purpose:** Validate complete Phase 1 implementation
**Status:** Ready for Execution
**Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes

---

## 🎯 Test Objectives

Validate that the complete Phase 1 implementation works end-to-end:

1. **Hub Sync Functionality** - Assets sync from hub to satellite
2. **Agent Rule Reading** - Agents read rules from hub cache
3. **Rule Updates Propagation** - Hub changes reach satellites
4. **Letta Memory Operations** - Persistent memory works
5. **Complete Workflow** - Full end-to-end validation

---

## 📋 Test Suite

### Test 1: Hub Sync Functionality

**Objective:** Verify hub assets sync correctly to satellite

**Steps:**

```bash
# Navigate to satellite project
cd D:\lunar-snake\personal-work\yokan-projects\lablab-bean

# Clean existing cache
task hub:clean

# Perform fresh sync
task hub:sync

# Verify sync results
task hub:check
```

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ Hub repo cloned to `.hub-cache/hub-repo`
- ✅ 15+ agent files synced to `.hub-cache/agents/`
- ✅ 1 NUKE file synced to `.hub-cache/nuke/`
- ✅ `.hub:check` reports success with file counts

**Success Criteria:**

- No error messages during sync
- Correct number of files synced
- Files accessible in cache directory

---

### Test 2: Agent Rule Reading

**Objective:** Verify agents can read rules from hub cache

**Steps:**

1. Open `lablab-bean` in VS Code
2. Start Cline/Roo/Kilo agent
3. Ask: **"What are our naming conventions? Check the agent rules."**

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ Agent accesses `.hub-cache/agents/rules/20-rules.md` or similar
- ✅ Agent quotes actual naming convention rules from hub
- ✅ Agent demonstrates understanding of rule structure

**Success Criteria:**

- Agent reads from hub cache (not local files)
- Accurate rule content quoted
- No "file not found" errors

---

### Test 3: Rule Updates Propagation

**Objective:** Verify hub rule updates propagate to satellites

**Steps:**

1. Edit a rule in `lunar-snake-hub/agents/rules/20-rules.md`
2. Commit and push change to hub
3. In `lablab-bean`: `task hub:sync`
4. Ask agent to read the updated rule
5. Verify agent sees new content

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ Hub change committed successfully
- ✅ Sync updates satellite cache
- ✅ Agent reads updated rule content
- ✅ Old content replaced with new content

**Success Criteria:**

- Changes propagate within sync cycle
- Agent accesses latest rule version
- No caching issues or stale content

---

### Test 4: Letta Memory Operations

**Objective:** Verify persistent memory functionality

**Part A: Memory Storage**

1. In lablab-bean, ask agent:
   **"Remember this decision: We chose Repository pattern for data access because it decouples domain from infrastructure."**
2. Verify agent calls Letta `save_memory`
3. Check for success confirmation

**Part B: Memory Retrieval**

1. Restart VS Code completely
2. Start fresh agent session
3. Ask: **"What pattern did we choose for data access and why?"**
4. Verify agent retrieves from Letta memory

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ Agent successfully saves memory via Letta
- ✅ Memory persists across VS Code restarts
- ✅ Agent retrieves accurate, complete memory content
- ✅ No memory loss or corruption

**Success Criteria:**

- Memory operations complete without errors
- Content preserved exactly as stored
- Fast retrieval (< 2 seconds)

---

### Test 5: Complete Workflow Integration

**Objective:** Validate end-to-end workflow with all components

**Steps:**

1. **Start with clean satellite**: Fresh clone or clean state
2. **Sync from hub**: `task hub:sync`
3. **Agent work session**:
   - Ask agent to check naming conventions
   - Make a technical decision
   - Ask agent to remember the decision
4. **Session restart**: Close and reopen VS Code
5. **Resume work**:
   - Ask agent about previous decision
   - Verify agent recalls via Letta
   - Continue work with context intact

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ Complete workflow operates smoothly
- ✅ No friction between components
- ✅ Context maintained throughout
- ✅ Productive development experience

**Success Criteria:**

- All components work together seamlessly
- No manual intervention required
- Agent demonstrates continuous learning

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Hub Sync Failures

**Symptoms**: Error messages during `task hub:sync`
**Solutions**:

- Check internet connectivity
- Verify hub repo accessibility
- Clear cache and retry: `task hub:clean && task hub:sync`
- Check Taskfile.yml configuration

#### Agent Rule Access Issues

**Symptoms**: Agent can't find or read rules
**Solutions**:

- Verify `.hub-cache/agents/` directory exists
- Check file permissions
- Confirm agent has filesystem access
- Restart VS Code to reload MCP configuration

#### Letta Memory Problems

**Symptoms**: Memory operations fail or don't persist
**Solutions**:

- Verify Letta server: `curl http://juis-mac-mini:5055/v1/health`
