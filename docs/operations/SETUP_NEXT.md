# 🚀 Next Steps - Push to GitHub & Start Phase 1

You've successfully created the local hub structure! Here's what to do next.

## 📋 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (5 min)

### 1.1 Go to GitHub

Visit: <https://github.com/organizations/GiantCroissant-Lunar/repositories/new>

### 1.2 Configure Repository

- **Repository name:** `lunar-snake-hub`
- **Description:** Central hub for lunar-snake projects - specs, agent rules, build components
- **Visibility:** ⭐ **Public** (to use free GitHub runner minutes)
- **Initialize:**
  - ❌ **DO NOT** add README (you already have one)
  - ❌ **DO NOT** add .gitignore (you already have one)
  - ❌ **DO NOT** add license yet

### 1.3 Click "Create repository"

---

## 📋 Step 2: Push to GitHub (5 min)

GitHub will show you commands. Use these instead (since you already have commits):

```bash
cd D:\lunar-snake\lunar-snake-hub

# Stage all files
git add .

# First commit
git commit -m "feat: initial hub structure with docs, agents, nuke, specs folders"

# Add remote (replace with actual URL from GitHub)
git remote add origin https://github.com/GiantCroissant-Lunar/lunar-snake-hub.git

# Push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Verify:** Visit `https://github.com/GiantCroissant-Lunar/lunar-snake-hub` - you should see your files!

---

## 📋 Step 3: Choose Your Path

You now have two options:

### Option A: Start Phase 1 Immediately (4 hours)

**If you have 4 uninterrupted hours right now:**

1. Open `docs/guides/PHASE1_CHECKLIST.md`
2. You've already done Task #1 (Create hub repo) ✅
3. Continue with Task #2 (Extract agent rules from lablab-bean)

**Command:**

```bash
# Open checklist
code D:\lunar-snake\lunar-snake-hub\docs\guides\PHASE1_CHECKLIST.md

# Or just start
cd D:\lunar-snake\personal-work\yokan-projects\lablab-bean
# Review .agent/ folder structure
```

---

### Option B: Wait for Weekend Block (Recommended)

**If you want to start fresh with focused time:**

**Today (Wed):**

- ✅ Hub repo created and pushed
- ✅ Structure documented
- 📖 Read `docs/architecture/YOUR_DECISIONS_SUMMARY.md` (30 min)

**Thu-Fri:**

- 🔧 Install missing tools (if any):

  ```bash
  # Check what you have
  task --version   # go-task
  yq --version     # YAML/TOML query
  sops --version   # Secrets encryption

  # Install if missing (Windows)
  scoop install task yq sops
  ```

**Saturday (4-hour block):**

- 🚀 Work through `PHASE1_CHECKLIST.md` start to finish
- 🎯 Goal: lablab-bean consuming hub + Letta memory working

**Next week:**

- 🧪 Use lablab-bean daily, validate Phase 1
- 📝 Note any friction points
- 🤔 Decide if Phase 2 (RAG) is needed

---

## 🎯 Quick Validation

Before you close for today, verify everything is set up:

```bash
# 1. Check git status
cd D:\lunar-snake\lunar-snake-hub
git status
# Should say: "On branch main, Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'"

# 2. Check GitHub
# Visit: https://github.com/GiantCroissant-Lunar/lunar-snake-hub
# You should see: README, folders, docs, etc.

# 3. Check docs are accessible
ls docs/architecture/
ls docs/guides/
# Should see all 5 docs

# 4. Check structure
ls agents/ nuke/ specs/ infra/
# Should see README.md in each
```

**All green?** You're ready! 🎉

## 📚 What to Read Next

Depending on your path:

**If starting Phase 1 today:**

1. `docs/guides/PHASE1_CHECKLIST.md` - Step-by-step implementation

**If waiting for weekend:**

1. `docs/architecture/YOUR_DECISIONS_SUMMARY.md` - Review decisions & rationale
2. `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_QUICK_REF.md` - Skim for familiarity
3. `docs/guides/PHASE1_CHECKLIST.md` - Pre-read to mentally prepare

**If you want deep dive:**

1. `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_DISCUSSION.md` - Full 16,000-word design doc
